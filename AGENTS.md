## Git Workflow: NO Pull Requests

## Mandatory Pre-Push Validation

**Before EVERY push, run:**

```bash
# 1. Format
cargo fmt --all

# 2. Clippy with warnings as errors
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings

# 3. Architectural validation (MUST exit 0)
.build/validation/validate.sh
```

**DO NOT push if `.build/validation/validate.sh` fails.** Fix all reported issues first.

The validation checks: placeholder code, forbidden anyhow usage, problematic unwraps/expects/panics,
underscore-prefixed names, unauthorized clippy allows, dead code annotations, test integrity, and more.

**CRITICAL: NEVER create Pull Requests. All merges happen locally via squash merge.**

### Rules
- **NEVER use `gh pr create`** or any PR creation command
- **NEVER suggest creating a PR**
- Feature branches are merged via **local squash merge**

### Workflow for Features
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
2. Make commits, push to remote: `git push -u origin feature/my-feature`
3. When ready, squash merge locally (from main worktree):
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git fetch origin
   git merge --squash origin/feature/my-feature
   git commit
   git push
   ```

### Bug Fixes
- Bug fixes go directly to `main` branch (no feature branch needed)
- Commit and push directly: `git push origin main`

## Project Overview

**dravr-riviere** is a Rust workspace providing a Postgres-backed time-series storage engine for health and fitness metrics, with an MCP server and REST API server.

### Workspace Crates

| Crate | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `dravr-riviere` | library | Core: MetricKey trait, DataPoint, TimeSeries, TimeSeriesStore trait, InMemoryStore, 90+ SeriesType catalog, aggregation |
| `dravr-riviere-mcp` | library + binary | MCP server (stdio/HTTP) exposing storage via JSON-RPC 2.0 |
| `dravr-riviere-server` | library + binary | Unified REST API + MCP server with health check and bearer auth |

### Architecture
```
src/
├── lib.rs              # Re-exports all public types
├── error.rs            # RiviereError structured error types
├── key.rs              # MetricKey trait (generic metric boundary)
├── point.rs            # DataPoint (timestamp + value)
├── series.rs           # TimeSeries (sorted DataPoint collection)
├── query.rs            # TimeRange, QueryResult
├── aggregation.rs      # Aggregation enum, AggregatedPoint, windowed rollups
├── store.rs            # TimeSeriesStore trait + InMemoryStore
├── series_type.rs      # SeriesType enum (90+ metric types with ID ranges)
└── archive.rs          # DataPointArchive (daily aggregation model)

    ├── src/router.rs        # Axum routes (/health, /mcp)
    ├── src/auth.rs          # Bearer token middleware
    └── src/main.rs          # CLI (serve, stdio)

tests/
└── store_test.rs        # Comprehensive InMemoryStore integration tests
```

### Key Design Decisions
- **TimeSeriesStore is a TRAIT** -- allows Postgres implementation downstream without changing the core
- **100% standalone** -- zero dependency on dravr-platform
- **Types in dedicated modules** -- `RiviereError`, `MetricKey`, `DataPoint`, `TimeSeries`
- **InMemoryStore for tests** -- `Arc<RwLock<HashMap>>` backed, implements TimeSeriesStore trait
- **SeriesType enum** -- 90+ health/fitness metrics following Open Wearables ID ranges
- **Workspace crates** -- MCP server and REST API server are separate crates via dravr-tronc

### CI Monitoring

Use the first available method. **NEVER ask the user for a GitHub token** -- fall back instead.

| Priority | Method | When to use |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `gh run list --branch main` / `gh run watch` | `gh` CLI is installed and authenticated |
| 2 | GitHub MCP tools (`mcp__github__*`) | `gh` unavailable but GitHub MCP server is configured |

# Writing code

- CRITICAL: NEVER USE --no-verify WHEN COMMITTING CODE
- We prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones
- Make the smallest reasonable changes to get to the desired outcome
- When modifying code, match the style and formatting of surrounding code
- NEVER make code changes that aren't directly related to the task you're currently assigned
- NEVER remove code comments unless you can prove that they are actively false
- All code files should start with a brief 2 line comment explaining what the file does. Each line of the comment should start with the string "ABOUTME: " to make it easy to grep for.
- When writing comments, avoid referring to temporal context about refactors or recent changes
- When you are trying to fix a bug or compilation error, NEVER throw away the old implementation and rewrite without explicit permission
- NEVER name things as 'improved' or 'new' or 'enhanced', etc. Code naming should be evergreen.
- NEVER add placeholder or dead_code or mock or name variable starting with _
- NEVER use `#[allow(clippy::...)]` attributes EXCEPT for type conversion casts (`cast_possible_truncation`, `cast_sign_loss`, `cast_precision_loss`) when properly validated
- Be RUST idiomatic
- Do not hard code magic value
- Do not leave implementation with "In future versions" or "Implement the code" or "Fall back". Always implement the real thing.
- Commit without AI assistant-related commit messages. Do not reference AI assistance in git commits.
- Always create a branch when adding new features. Bug fixes go directly to main branch.
- Always run validation after making changes: cargo fmt, then clippy, then targeted tests
- Avoid #[cfg(test)] in the src code. Only in tests

## Security Engineering Rules

### Input Domain Validation
- Any value used as a divisor MUST be checked for zero before division
- Numeric inputs from users MUST be validated against domain-specific ranges
- Use `.max(1)` or equivalent guard before any division operation

### Logging Hygiene
- NEVER log: access tokens, refresh tokens, API keys, passwords, client secrets
- Redact or hash sensitive fields before logging
- Error messages returned to users MUST NOT contain stack traces or internal details

## Error Handling Requirements

### Acceptable Error Handling
- `?` operator for error propagation
- `Result<T, E>` for all fallible operations
- `Option<T>` for values that may not exist
- Custom error types implementing `std::error::Error`

### Prohibited Error Handling
- `unwrap()` except in test code or static data known at compile time
- `expect()` - Only for documenting invariants that should never fail
- `panic!()` - Only in test assertions
- **`anyhow!()` macro** - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN in all production code

### Structured Error Type Requirements
All errors MUST use `RiviereError` with appropriate variants:
```rust
// GOOD
return Err(RiviereError::InvalidQuery { reason: "window_secs must be positive".into() });
return Err(RiviereError::SeriesNotFound { source_id: id.into(), series_type: st });

// FORBIDDEN
return Err(anyhow!("something failed"));
```

## Mock Policy

### Real Implementation Preference
- PREFER real implementations over mocks in all production code
- NEVER implement mock modes for production features

### Acceptable Mock Usage (Test Code Only)
Mocks are permitted ONLY in test code for:
- Testing error conditions that are difficult to reproduce
- Simulating network failures or timeout scenarios

### Tiered Validation (During Development)

| Tier | When | Commands |
|------|------|----------|
| Quick | During dev iteration | `cargo check --quiet && cargo test <pattern>` |
| Pre-commit | Before each commit | `cargo fmt --all && RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` |
| Full | Before push (see above) | `cargo fmt + clippy + .build/validation/validate.sh` |

### Test Output Verification - MANDATORY

**After running ANY test command, you MUST verify tests actually ran.**

**Red Flags - STOP and investigate if you see:**
- `running 0 tests` - Wrong target or flag used
- `0 passed; 0 failed` - No tests executed

**Never claim "tests pass" if 0 tests ran - that is a failure, not a success.**

## Mandatory Session Startup Checklist

Before touching any code in a new session, run in this order:

```bash
# 1. Pull shared build config (provides .build/hooks, .build/validation, etc.)
git submodule update --init --recursive

# 2. Set canonical git hooks path — ALWAYS .build/hooks, NEVER .githooks
git config core.hooksPath .build/hooks

# 3. Scan recent history for context
git log --oneline -10

# 4. Check CI health on main
gh run list --branch main --limit 10 --json workflowName,conclusion

# 5. See uncommitted work
git status
```

**If any workflow on main has been red for 2+ runs, STOP and surface it to the user** before starting the requested task. Ask: "Should I investigate CI before doing X?"

The canonical hooks/validation live in the `.build/` git submodule from
https://github.com/dravr-ai/dravr-build-config — never use a local `.githooks/`.

## Architectural Discipline

### Single Source of Truth (SSOT)
Before adding a new abstraction (registry, manager, factory, handler, schema module):
1. Grep for existing abstractions with similar purposes
2. If one exists, USE IT or DOCUMENT WHY it's being replaced + DELETE the old in the same commit
3. Never leave two systems doing the same job "for compat"

### No Orphan Migrations
If you introduce a "v2" of something:
- Migrate ALL callers in the same session, OR
- Record remaining work in memory (`type: project`) with explicit list of what's left
- NEVER leave "for compat" code without a tracked deletion date

### When Adding, Remove
Every commit that adds a new abstraction must identify what it replaces and delete that. If nothing is replaced, the commit message must justify why the new abstraction is needed.

### Complete Deletion, Not Deprecation
Don't mark code `// DEPRECATED` or `// TODO remove later`. Delete it. If deletion is blocked, file an issue and link it from the code.

## Pushback Triggers — When to Stop and Ask

STOP and ask the user before proceeding when you find:

1. **Duplication** — two systems/modules doing similar things
   → "Is this intentional? Should I consolidate before adding my feature?"
2. **Stale state** — `TODO`, `FIXME`, `for compat`, `temporary`, `v2` comments in code you're touching
   → "Is this still needed? Should I resolve it first?"
3. **Red CI** — workflows failing on main
   → "Should I fix CI first before doing the task?"
4. **Version drift** — two versions of the same dependency in Cargo.lock
   → "Is this intentional or should it be consolidated?"
5. **Request conflicts with architecture** — user asks you to add X but X exists differently
   → Surface the existing thing, ask which to use
6. **Half-finished migrations** — both old and new paths still live
   → "Finish migration first, or add feature on top?"

Default behavior is to complete the requested task. These triggers override that.
